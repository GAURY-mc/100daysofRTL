# ðŸ”§ 100 Days of RTL Challenge

Welcome to my personal journey through **100 Days of RTL Design using Verilog**!  
This challenge is powered by the **NPTEL course: Hardware Modelling using Verilog** and daily problem-solving on **HDLBits**.

---

## ðŸ“… Day 1 â€“ Getting Started

Today marks the beginning of my RTL design journey. I learned:

- The basic structure of a Verilog module
- How to define inputs, outputs, and use the `assign` statement
- Implemented a simple **AND gate** as my first Verilog program
- Simulated it to understand truth tables and waveform outputs

I used HDLBits for practice and simulated the design using Icarus Verilog.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Platforms

- **NPTEL Course:** Hardware Modelling using Verilog  
- **Practice Site:** [HDLBits](https://hdlbits.01xz.net)  
- **Simulator:** Icarus Verilog + GTKWave (for future use)

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

My goal is to complete 100 continuous days of learning, starting from basic gates to complex RTL systems, FSMs, and synthesis-ready Verilog.

Stay tuned for Day 2!
